As of November 4, 2022, Nutmeg has now been updated to [ZGB 2022.0](https://github.com/Zal0/ZGB) (and [GBDK 2020 v4.1.0](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020))! Code is mainly uploaded here for backup and reference purposes, it's missing a few things so if you try to compile it, some things might be broken for now. But a demo is coming pretty soon. :)

## Where to Get It

Nutmeg will be sold exclusively through Incube8 Games! Release date TBA. Hoping to release on a physical cartridge.
