TODO 

* nutmeg bow shouldn't lag behind
* create nutmeg_die fn for all enemies to use
* fade out when going from owrld 1 to world 2 - maybe force a state change to the same state? 
* Overworld - show tree, mushroom and boss levels with a different tile instead of numbers ie lvl 1-tree
* Do water and flag tile updates from a single fn, so we can do 1 per frame max, also do via cgb dma
* stage 2_1, scroll off the left hand side of the map
