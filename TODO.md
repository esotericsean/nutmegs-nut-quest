TODO 

* Overworld - show tree, mushroom and boss levels with a different tile instead of numbers ie lvl 1-tree
* Do water and flag tile updates from a single fn, so we can do 1 per frame max, also do via cgb dma
* Fix palettes and flagpole at the end of the rain level
* level start in the freefall level gets messed up if you drop too fast while it is flashing
